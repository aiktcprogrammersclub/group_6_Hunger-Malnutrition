<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="white"> Your support is invaluable to our life-saving work. Help us continue to fight hunger by making a tax-deductible gift today.

Action Against Hunger works in many countries around the world; some broken by natural disaster, others by man-made catastrophe. When in a state of emergency, all of them need everything. Action Against Hunger is there to provide food, clean water, sanitation and other basic needs. We then stay to help countries return to self-sufficiency.

Public Health Resource Network (PHRN) in collaboration with its partners (Child In Need Institute, Ekjut, Chaupal, Idea and Jan Swasthya Sahyog) has initiated a project named “Action against Malnutrition:  A multi-strategy intervention in seven blocks of four states”. This project is financially supported by Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Allied Trusts. Initially, this project is implemented in 7 blocks in the states of Bihar (1 block), Chhattisgarh (1 block), Jharkhand (3 blocks), and Odisha (2 blocks). Duration of the project is of three years and the formative work is already underway.



</p>
<p>
The project focuses on children and child nutrition in the age group of six months to three years, which needs additional attention and care under any government scheme. The main objective of the project is to reduce/combat malnutrition through community mobilization and community based management of malnutrition.



</p>


<p>
The project plans to address issues of:
<ul>
<li>Adequate and quality food</li>
       <li> Every child is exclusively breastfed from birth to six months</li>
       <li> Complimentary feeding for 6 months – 3 yrs with dietary diversity</li>
       <li> All children with malnutrition get locally produced calorie dense, protein rich foods</li>
        <li>Pregnancy and maternal care
    <li>Disease prevention, treatment and rehabilitation
        </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
 <p>Convergence between WCD and Health Department (ICDS and NRHM) for referral to NRC / MTC and follow up of children discharged from the same, as well as treatment of childhood diseases and immunization
    Care and stimulation
    Other determinants that would include NREGA/PDS/family planning
        
        The specific objectives are:
        </p>
<ul>
<li> Working with children 0-3 years</li> 
  <li>   Mobilizing communities on malnutrition towards preventive, promotional and curative efforts</li>
   <li>  Strengthening public systems, mainly ICDS and NRHM; but also systems for other social determinants of malnutrition such as water and sanitation, for better service delivery
  </li> <li>  Attempting to fill the programmatic gaps for child care and community based management of malnutrition</li>
  <li>   Developing a model for scalability</li>
   <li>  Influencing the policy environment towards changes that are essential to tackling malnutrition, on the basis of this programme
</li>

</ul>
