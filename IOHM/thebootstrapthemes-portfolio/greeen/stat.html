<font color="white">Malnutrition in children causes serious health problems, the most prominent being stunting and wasting. Stunting occurs in children because the small amount of nutrients that they get goes straight to their vital organs, such as the lungs and the heart and towards growth. Wasting is when a child does not consume the proper amount of food for them to get the calories that they need. When this happens their body will begin to digest its own muscle in order to obtain protein, minerals, and energy (Health and Nutrition).<p>Wasting is caused by severe and often times a sudden lack of food. Sudden lack of food can come from a bad harvest season, or sometimes families have to flee their homes due to conflict and they must leave their food stocks behind (Hunger Pains).

Famines are often causes of lack of food</p>.<p> There have been many famines that have swept through parts of Africa. The East Africa Famine of 2011 caused serious food shortages in the countries of Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, and Kenya (Stanford, Claire).
<p>
Malnutrition usually leads to death by another issue. This is a problem because malnutrition then does not show up on death certificates, so people underestimate its seriousness. Malnutrition can lead to deaths by diarrhea, malaria, pneumonia, and the measles (Health and Nutrition).

Often times children are not at risk of malnutrition because of lack of food, but because they are so poor they simply cannot afford to buy food.

	<ul>
   <li> About 500 million children under the age of 14 are in serious danger of growing up with physical and mental deficiencies or will die during the next 15 years</li>
  <li>  Roughly eighty percent of children who suffer from malnutrition live in just 20 countries that are located in Africa and Asia<li>
 <li>   In the United States of America greater than 15 million children do not know where their next meal may be coming from<li>
 <li>   Ever 2 in 5 children who suffer from malnutrition will have stunted growth.<li>
 <li>   55.5 million children (9% of children in the world) are suffering from wasting </p>
