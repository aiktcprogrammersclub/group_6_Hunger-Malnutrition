<h1>Types of malnutritions</h1>
<ul>
<li>Protien-energy malnutrition </li>
<li>Micronutrient Malnutrition
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Protein–energy malnutrition</h1>
<p>  Protein–energy malnutrition (PEM) or protein–calorie malnutrition refers to a form of malnutrition where there is inadequate calorie or protein intake.

PEM is fairly common worldwide in both children and adults and accounts for 6 million deaths annually.In the industrialized world, PEM is predominantly seen in hospitals, is associated with disease, or is often found in the elderly.[3]
Note that PEM may be secondary to other conditions such as chronic renal disease or cancer cachexia in which protein energy wasting may occur.

Protein–energy malnutrition affects children the most because they have less protein intake. The few rare cases found in the developed world are almost entirely found in small children as a result of fad diets, or ignorance of the nutritional needs of children, particularly in cases of milk allergy.</p>>
<h2> Micronutrient deficiency</h2> 
Micronutrient deficiency is a lack of essential vitamins and minerals required in small amounts by the body for proper growth and development. <p>Micronutrients include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamins A, B, C and D</li> 
<li>Calcium </li>
<li>Folate </li>
<li>Iodine </li>
<li>Iron </li>
<li>Zinc </li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>

<h1>What is Iron?</h1>
<p>Iron is a micronutrient that is essential to the structure of every cell in the body, but particularly red blood cells (hemoglobin), which transport oxygen in the blood to tissues in the body. In addition, iron is also a key component in proteins in muscle tissue and is critical for the normal development of the central nervous system. 
<ul>Iron is rich in foods such as:
<li>Meats, poultry and fish </li>
<li>Fortified cereals and oatmeal </li>
<li>Legumes (e.g. soybeans and lentils) </li>
<li>Leafy greens </li>
<li>Seeds (e.g. sesame and pumpkin) </li>
<h1>What is Iron Deficiency?</h1>
<p>
In iron deficiency, the amount of iron stored away for later use is reduced as indexed by a low serum ferritin level, but has no effect on the iron needed to meet the daily needs of an individual. If the body requires increased iron (due to a rapid growth spurt, for example), a person with inadequate stored iron has no reserves to use. When the body lacks sufficient iron to make adequate hemoglobin, red blood cells cannot transport adequate oxygen to tissues throughout the body. This can cause iron-deficiency anemia, an advanced stage of iron deficiency. Iron is also critical for normal cardiac and skeletal muscle function and is a key component of enzymes involved in the development of the brain. Learn how to identify iron deficiency.
