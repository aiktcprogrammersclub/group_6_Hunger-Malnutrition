First, there is no reason why we can't develop more complementary approaches that integrate what works for both sectors. Given how hard it is to get real agricultural productivity improvements and to take nutrition specific interventions to scale, there is clearly real value in developing programmes that co-locate multiple approaches and pathways to impact in the same geographic areas. And while providing inputs to support agricultural productivity, we should do more to fill the nutrient gaps in the household by encouraging better use of nutrient dense crops and animal sources of protein. Combining these approaches with targeted nutrition interventions such as education, support for exclusive breastfeeding and complementary feeding, micronutrient supplementation where needed, as well as hygiene and sanitation, would collectively give us a far better chance to achieve measurable success in reducing stunting and undernutrition. To do this we have to break down the silos between the various sectors and develop delivery together. I believe GAIN can do more to pilot integrated models that reach large numbers of households and at the same time build the evidence base to demonstrate impact.</p>

<p> Second, we can no longer ignore the irony that in many parts of the world suffering from the highest levels of undernutrition, there is often extremely limited demand for nutritious foods. Without greater demand for more nutritious food, it is unlikely that farmers will choose to grow more nutritious crops, nor will consumers pay for such food products. We can encourage governments to build more awareness about nutrition, and hope that nutrition education will one day be delivered by agriculture extension workers, but these interventions will take a long time to deliver real change. Yet there is another approach that could work: encouraging smallholder farmers, local entrepreneurs, and a variety of small, medium and larger business to build this market for the benefit of consumers from the ground up. This means that we need to encourage businesses to develop nutritious offerings for the marketplace at the same time as creating demand for them.</p>
<p>

<p> GAIN has been working on this for the past three years and sees wide-ranging opportunities here. A few examples from Africa targeted to low income consumers and producers include: small businesses selling chicken parts; producing and selling Nile tilapia and catfish fingerlings; introduction of coin operated pasteurised milk dispensing machines offering small qualities of milk; provision of drying technology for fruits and vegetable to allow consumption all year around; and assistance with growing and processing locally nutritious crops such as millet, soya and maringa. Each of these projects will entail building its own market and combined with many other efforts such as those on biofortification, will start to build a market for nutritious foods.</p>

<p>Forging stronger links between agriculture and nutrition sectors is a critical big part of eliminating malnutrition. So we need to start using the investments pledged in London for programmes on the ground in countries around the world. Let's start developing more programmes that combine multiple interventions across agriculture and nutrition, and also more aggressively begin building markets for nutritious foods that reach the poor.
